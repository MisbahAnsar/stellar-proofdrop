# ProveIt

Production-ready Stellar Soroban dApp for paid tasks with on-chain proof verification.

Users create small paid tasks, lock XLM in a smart contract, and release payment when proof is approved. Proof files are stored off-chain (local storage for now); only the SHA-256 hash is stored on-chain.

## Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui
- **Wallet:** Freighter (`@stellar/freighter-api`)
- **Stellar:** `@stellar/stellar-sdk` (Soroban RPC)
- **Data:** TanStack React Query v5, React Hook Form, Zod
- **Contracts:** Rust, Soroban SDK 25
- **Package manager:** Bun

See [contracts/README.md](contracts/README.md) for contract architecture details.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (recommended) or Node.js 20+
- [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/) browser extension
- Rust 1.84+ and `wasm32v1-none` target (for contracts)

```bash
rustup target add wasm32v1-none
```

### Install

```bash
bun install
```

### Environment variables

Copy the example file and adjust as needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

| Variable                          | Description                              | Default                 |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`             | Public app URL                           | `http://localhost:3000` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK`     | Stellar network (`testnet` \| `mainnet`) | `testnet`               |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL`     | Soroban RPC endpoint (optional)          | network default         |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROVEIT_CONTRACT_ID` | Deployed ProveIt contract ID             | —                       |

Environment variables are validated at runtime via `src/lib/env.ts`.

### Development

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Frontend features

### Wallet

- Connect / disconnect via Freighter
- Wallet status in navbar (truncated address + network)
- Session hydration on page load

### Create Task (`/create`)

- Zod-validated form: title, description, reward (XLM), optional deadline
- Full Soroban transaction flow: prepare → sign → submit → confirm
- Pending, success, and failed states with inline status UI
- Toast notifications for each transaction phase
- Parses `TaskCreated` contract events from confirmed transactions
- Off-chain metadata stored in `localStorage` (title, description, deadline)
- Task list refreshes automatically via React Query (no page reload)

### Submit Proof (`/tasks/[taskId]`)

Workers open a task, upload proof, and submit only the hash on-chain:

1. **File validation** — JPEG, PNG, WebP, PDF, or plain text up to 5 MB
2. **Proof preview** — local preview of the selected or stored proof file
3. **SHA-256 hash** — computed client-side before any chain call
4. **Local storage** — full proof file saved in `localStorage` (mock off-chain store)
5. **On-chain submit** — `submit_proof` stores the 32-byte hash and sets status to `ProofSubmitted`
6. **Loading states** — hashing, transaction pending, success, and error UI
7. **Creator verification** — compares local proof hash against the on-chain hash

### Creator Review (`/tasks/[taskId]` and `/dashboard`)

Creators see pending submissions and can approve or reject:

1. **Pending queue** — dashboard lists tasks with `proof_submitted` status awaiting review
2. **Approve** — releases locked XLM to the worker, sets status to `Approved`, emits `task_approved`
3. **Reject** — clears proof hash, returns task to `Open` for resubmission, emits `task_rejected`
4. **Transaction flow** — same prepare → sign → submit → confirm pattern with loading and error UI
5. **Auto-refresh** — React Query + `taskEventBus` update lists and task detail without reload

### Task list & events

- Home (`/`) shows a live task list with links to task detail
- `taskEventBus` broadcasts local create/update/refresh/activity events across pages
- Background Soroban RPC `getEvents` listener polls contract events
- React Query invalidation keeps dashboard and lists in sync after on-chain confirmation

### Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

Responsive overview with live sections — no manual refresh:

| Section | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **My Tasks** | Tasks you created |
| **Open Tasks** | Tasks available for proof submission |
| **Completed Tasks** | Approved and paid out |
| **Pending Reviews** | Submissions awaiting your decision |
| **Recent Activity** | Live feed from local and on-chain events |

- Summary stat cards for each section
- `taskEventBus` subscriptions + Soroban RPC polling keep tasks and activity in sync
- React Query invalidation on create, update, and activity events

## Continuous integration

GitHub Actions runs on every push and pull request to `main`:

| Job        | Steps                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Frontend   | `lint` → `typecheck` → `test:frontend` → `build` |
| Contracts  | `cargo test` in `contracts/`               |

Workflow file: [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)

## Soroban contract

The `proveit` contract supports task creation with on-chain fund locking, proof submission, and creator review.

| Function         | Description                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `initialize`     | Configure the reward token (XLM SAC)                |
| `create_task`    | Lock funds, store task, emit `TaskCreated` event      |
| `submit_proof`   | Worker submits proof hash, emits `ProofSubmitted`   |
| `approve_task`   | Creator approves, releases reward to worker           |
| `reject_task`    | Creator rejects, reopens task for resubmission      |
| `get_task`       | Read task by ID                                     |
| `get_task_count` | Total tasks created                                 |
| `get_token`      | Configured token address                            |

Each task stores `creator`, `reward`, `proof_hash`, `worker`, and `status`. Twenty-eight unit tests cover initialization, validation, fund locking, proof submission, creator review, events, and error paths.

> **Note:** Redeploy the contract after pulling contract changes before testing on testnet.

## Tooling

### Tailwind CSS

- Tailwind v4 with PostCSS (`postcss.config.mjs`)
- Theme tokens in `src/app/globals.css`
- Light theme only: white background, gray borders, no gradients

### shadcn/ui

- Initialized with `components.json`
- Add components: `bunx shadcn@latest add <component>`

## UI conventions

- **Light theme only** — no dark mode, no gradients
- **White background** (`--background`)
- **Gray borders** (`--border`)
- **Minimal aesthetic** — clean cards, dashed empty states, skeleton loaders
- **Accessibility** — skip link, focus rings, `aria-current` nav, form error associations, `role="alert"` for validation
- **Loading** — skeleton placeholders instead of plain text; `keepPreviousData` to avoid list flicker on refresh
- **Errors** — route-level `error.tsx` boundary and dedicated `not-found.tsx` page
- **Reusable primitives** — `PageHeader`, `EmptyState`, `Skeleton`, `FieldError`, `LoadingRegion`, `ErrorFallback`
